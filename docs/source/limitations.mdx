## Known Limitations

### OAuth Token Passthrough

**Current Implementation**: The Apollo MCP Server currently passes through OAuth tokens received from MCP clients directly to upstream GraphQL APIs.

**MCP Specification Violation**: This behavior violates the [MCP Authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization), which states:

> "If the MCP server makes requests to upstream APIs, it may act as an OAuth client to them. The access token used at the upstream API is a separate token, issued by the upstream authorization server. The MCP server **MUST NOT** pass through the token it received from the MCP client."

**Why We Violate the Specification**: 

The decision to pass through tokens stems from practical enterprise requirements that conflict with the MCP specification:

- **Multi-user scenarios**: Enterprise GraphQL APIs often require direct user identity to perform granular access control and tenant isolation
- **Existing enterprise patterns**: Many organizations have GraphQL APIs that depend on the original Authorization header to identify users and apply existing identity-based access controls
- **Multi-tenant applications**: Upstream APIs frequently need to read the Authorization header to identify the tenant and apply appropriate data filtering
- **User context propagation**: The MCP specification lacks clear guidance on how user/session/identity information should reach upstream APIs when they need to perform their own authorization logic

**Security Implications**: 
- Token passthrough can lead to confused deputy vulnerabilities
- Upstream APIs may incorrectly trust tokens as if they were validated by the MCP server
- Tokens intended for the MCP server audience may be inappropriately used with different services
- However, if upstream APIs enforce proper audience (`aud` claim) validation, they should reject inappropriately scoped tokens

**Recommended Workaround**: 
- Use the MCP server only with GraphQL APIs that accept the same OAuth tokens and audiences
- Ensure your OAuth authorization server issues tokens with appropriate audience claims for both the MCP server and upstream APIs
- Verify that your upstream APIs properly validate token audiences
- Consider the security implications in your threat model, especially regarding OAuth trust boundaries

**Future Plans**: We plan to address this limitation in a future release by implementing proper token exchange or separate authentication flows for upstream APIs, while still supporting the enterprise requirement for user identity propagation.
